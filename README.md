This is a collection of notes, snippets, and templates that I've written as I learn ZIL (the Zork Implementation Language). 

- **Snippets** - Small snippets of ZIL code that may contain functionality useful enough to slip into a project.
- **Template** - A starting point for new ZIL games. Includes a makefile for easily compiling and running.
- **getzilf.sh** - A script for macOS that will download the latest version of Zilf and 'install' it.
- **notes.md** - Notes I've taken about routines, MDL syntax, action handlers, additional resources, etc.
